#summary Swapping audio streams

== Let's do a little math ... ==

You have 2 video files, A and B, with principally same content. Now you want to watch the video, but for some reason, e.g. higher stream quality, you want to play back the video stream of A while you listen to the audio stream of B.
You could try to open two windows, one for each file, mute A and minimize B.

*Problem:*
The video playback is not synchronized to the audio playback. Sooner or later this will start to annoy you.

*Approach*:
Video A and video B are in sync with their appropriate audio streams,
so syncing the video frames will also sync the audio streams.

 # Find two frames, showing the same content, in the beginning of the videos.
 # Note their numbers.
 # Do it again for another frame at the end of the videos.

From these values, you get:
 # the relative frame shift
 # the relative speed

With these values, you can set up e.g. _mplayer_ and do a synced playback.
